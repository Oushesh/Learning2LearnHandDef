## Learning to learn a hand deformation model 

## The overall loss function should look something like this: lambda_1*affine_transform_hand + lambda_2*movement_fingers.
   The idea is model the affine transform of the hand rotation separate and onto of that we movement of fingers. (Then rotated as well)
